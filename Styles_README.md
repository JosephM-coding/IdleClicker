Here’s a **README** file for the **CSS file (`styles.css`) only**, focusing on its structure, styling choices, and custom components.

## README - `styles.css`

### Overview

The `styles.css` file provides the complete styling for a web-based clicker game, themed around space exploration. It defines the visual layout, responsive behaviors, and aesthetic feel of all UI components, including navigation, game containers, modals, and interactive elements.

---

### Global Styles

* **Reset Defaults:**

  ```css
  * {
      padding: 0;
      margin: 0;
  }
  ```

  Resets default browser spacing to create a consistent baseline.

* **Body:**

  ```css
  body {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
      background-image: url(SpaceBackground.webp);
      background-repeat: repeat;
      height: 100%;
  }
  ```

  Applies a space-themed background and centers the layout.

### Navigation Bar

* `.navBar`: Top section displaying time and links with centered content and borders.

---

### Game Container

* `.game-container`: Uses a 5-column CSS grid to layout the **left**, **middle**, and **right** UI sections with visual separators (`2%` gaps).

---

### Section Breakdown

#### Left Container (`.left-container`)

* Contains the main clickable image.
* `.Clicker-display` has an animated "tilt" effect.
* `.Clickerimg` is a circular, responsive image.

#### Middle Container (`.middle-container`)

* Contains:

  * `.CashCount-box`: Shows current player cash.
  * `.progress-box`: Save/load/delete buttons.
  * `.Interface`: Game control buttons (Inventory, Upgrades, Theme).
  * `.AlertBox`: Logs game events like purchases.

#### Right Container (`.right-container`)

* Displays all available upgrades.
* `.right-container-inners` and `.right-container-inners-upgraded`: Different layouts for normal and "rebirth" upgrades.

---

### Theming and Effects

* **Animations:**

  * `@keyframes tilt`: Rotates the image gently.
  * `@keyframes tilt2`: Used for effects like click bounce.

* **Theme Support:**

  * Supports dark and light themes by altering background and text colors dynamically.

* **Responsive Design:**

  * Media queries for screens <772px adjust font sizes, layout widths, and component spacing for mobile-friendliness.

---

### Utility Classes

* `.noselect`: Disables user text selection.
* `.hidden`: Fully hides elements using `display: none !important`.
* `.Affordable`, `.UnAffordable:hover`: Used to visually indicate affordability of upgrades.
* `.clickable-item`: Applies a hover effect and scale transformation.

---

### Modals

* `.Inventory`, `.Upgrades`: Hidden by default; shown via JavaScript when triggered.
* Contain custom tables and upgrade lists with defined borders and scroll behaviors.

---

### Fonts & Links

* Custom fonts loaded from Google Fonts (`Pixelify Sans`, `Jersey 10`, etc.).
* `.LinkClass`: Styled hyperlinks that change on hover.

---

## Recommendations

* Consider modularizing CSS with SASS or CSS modules for scalability.
* Use CSS variables for theme management to simplify toggling.
* Add transition effects to improve modal and button interactions.
